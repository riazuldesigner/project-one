                <h2><ins><mark>Mission:</mark></ins></h2>
                <p align="justify">To find peacefulness within myself by looking inward while using my heart to guide my dreams and desires, and my mind to pursue knowledge, creating balance among all of my obligations. To content myself in my surroundings so I will always know where security lies within my life. To build a reputation of being dedicated to every goal I choose to pursue while having successes in both my personal and professional life. To enjoy every moment along this journey finding laughter, love, and happiness with each day that passes.</p>
                <h2><ins><mark>Vision:</mark></ins></h2>
                <p align="justify">I want to have a career/life that includes constant learning and improvement for myself, but that also creates an atmosphere of pleasurable learning and improvement for others. I want to work with and around people, and it is important to me that they like me; but it is even more important to me that they feel that I have helped them in some way – not necessarily that I do a specific good deed, but more that some kindness or thoughtfulness or wisdom of mine has touched them.</p>
                <h2><ins><mark>Dream:</mark></ins></h2>
                <p align="justify">When I was younger, my dream was to be an engineer. As I studied in Computer Science & Engineering, I want to be a good developer. My intention is to execute my engineering knowledge through a well reputed organization if I get a good chance. Another dream is to buy a car by which I can travel from one place to another with my parents. After experiencing different knowledge from different organizations, my wish is to utilize my experience by building my own IT firm where a number of employees will get chance to execute their skills.   </p>
